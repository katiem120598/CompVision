To recreate the results of this report, please take the following steps.

REQUIRED FOR RECREATION OF RESULST
1. Extract all contents of this zip file into the same location.
2. In the directory in which these files are stored, run "python test_systematic.py" in your terminal.
This code will show the resulting images used in the paper as pop-ups. It will also output a csv file with the numerical % errors found in the study. This csv will be entitled "reconstruction_errors_with_noise.csv" if the code is run as is, and it will save over the file used to produce the results in the study. A random seed was not specified, so results may vary between runs (though overall conclusions remain unchanged.)

OPTIONAL FOR MORE EXPLORATION
1. In the directory in which these files are stored, run "python basis_new.py" in your terminal.
2. In the directory in which these files are stored, run "python rotation_revised.py" in your terminal.
** If you would like additional visualizations, you can uncomment lines 65-66 in "basis_new.py" and lines 147-150 in "rotation_revised.py."
